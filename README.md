From The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/blog-api)

- **Built with ReactJS**
- **Custom CSS**
- **Deployed on Github Pages**

This is the frontend of a blog website. It makes API calls to the [backend](https://github.com/run-after/blog-backend) that was made with Node.js.

There is one author - who can log in and see every blog post, whether it is published or not. The author can write blog posts, edit blog posts, delete blog posts, and publish/unpublish the posts. The user can also write comments on each post, and delete them.

If the author is not logged in, the user will only see published posts. The unauthorized person can also write comments on posts. They will not have the options of an authorized user.
